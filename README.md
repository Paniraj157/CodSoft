Exited share my accomplishment 4 tasks in the Java Programming Internship at CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰ 

Completed Task 1: Number Game ðŸ”¢
Completed Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
Completed Task 3: ATM Interface
Completed Task 4:

During this task, I delivered into creating an interactive all task using Java program. Here's what I accomplished â¬‡ 

Task 1: Number Game
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100. 
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number. 
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number. 
You can incorporate additional details as follows: 
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number. 
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again. 
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

ðŸ”‘ Key features & learning
* Utilizing a java program to implemented a number guessing game with a new target number for each completion of all attempts.
* Building a user interaction game with more attempts like, once we finish the game, we can choose if continue or not.
*It is a more fun of playing with improving our logical ability and proficiency in a code. ðŸ“ˆ

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
1. INPUT: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
2. Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
3.Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.
4.Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
5.Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

ðŸ”‘ Key features & learning
* Utilizing a java program to implemented a Student grading system.
* Entering total number of subjects and with marks. Adding all the marks to find a average percentage. Set a grading system for certain range of percentages
*It is a more fun to improving our logical ability and proficiency in a code. ðŸ“ˆ

Task 3: ATM Interface
1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure

ðŸ”‘ Key features & learning
* Utilizing a java program to implemented a ATM Interface
* Creating an 3 classes as ATM, Bank account, main. In a Bank account class, we initialized the current value for balance, deposit and withdraw . In a ATM class, we did interaction of deposit, withdraw and updating the balance amount. In a main class, we use switch cases for choose an option for the user to run the program.
*It is a more fun to improving our logical ability and proficiency in a code. ðŸ“ˆ

Task 4: Student Management System
1. Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll number, grade, and any other relevant details.
2. Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.  
3 . Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
4. Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database.
5. Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all students, and exiting the application.
6. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ASK

ðŸ”‘ Key features & learning
* Utilizing a java program to implemented a Student Management System
* Creating an 3 classes as Student, student management system and main. In a Student class , we declare all the details of the student and implements an serializable to import an java.io package, the interaction could be done in student management system. In a main method we declare all the choices of the student data and user can interact here and can run the program.
*It is a more fun to improving our logical ability and proficiency in a code. ðŸ“ˆ

Coming to an java programming into practical application is an challenging task. It was an great experience to improve our skills.ðŸš€
